1. `git branch`: This command is used to list all the branches in your repository.

2. `git merge dev1`: This command is used to merge the changes from the 'dev1' branch into the current branch, which is typically the 'Master' or 'Main' branch.

3. `git branch -d BRANCH_NAME`: This command is used to delete a specified branch, but it should only be used after committing your changes.
